# :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: The QuML player for the Sunbird!
The QuML player library components are powered by Angular. This player is primarily designed to be used on Sunbird consumption platforms (mobile app, web portal, offline desktop app) to drive reusability and maintainability, hence reducing the redundant development effort significantly, and it can be integrated with any platform irrespective of the platforms and the frontend frameworks. It is exported not only as an angular library but also as a web component aims to make it easy to share, discover, and reuse web components. It creates a framework agnostic way of composing and repurposing code. 

# :bookmark_tabs: Getting started with integration steps
The QuML player can be integrated as a web component and also as an angular library in angular application projects and it can also be integrated into any mobile framework as a web component.

# Use as web components :earth_asia:
QuML Library can also be used as web component which means if your project does not use a JavaScript framework but prefers platform-based HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you may wish to use QuML Library in this way simply follow below-mentioned steps to use it in plain JavaScript project:

- Insert [library](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/blob/release-5.7.0/web-component/sunbird-quml-player.js) as below:
  ```javascript
  <script  type="text/javascript"  src="sunbird-quml-player.js"></script>
  ```
- Create a asset folder and copy all the files from [here](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/tree/release-5.7.0/web-component/assets), library requires these assets internally to work well.

- Create a custom HTML element: `sunbird-quml-player`
  ```javascript
  const  qumlPlayerElement = document.createElement('sunbird-quml-player');
  ```

-  - Get sample playerConfig from here: [playerConfig](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/blob/release-5.7.0/projects/quml-demo-app/src/app/quml-library-data.ts) and pass data using `player-config`
  ```javascript
  qumlPlayerElement.setAttribute('player-config', JSON.stringify(playerConfig));
  ```
  **Note:** Attribute should be in **string** type

- Pass the Question List API baseUrl for, e.g. 
```
 window.questionListUrl = 'https://staging.sunbirded.org/api/question/v1/list';
```
- Listen for the output events: **playerEvent** and **telemetryEvent**

  ```javascript
  qumlPlayerElement.addEventListener('playerEvent', (event) => {
    console.log("On playerEvent", event);
  });
  qumlPlayerElement.addEventListener('telemetryEvent', (event) => {
    console.log("On telemetryEvent", event);
  });
  ```

- Append this element to existing element
  ```javascript
  const myPlayer = document.getElementById("my-player");
  myPlayer.appendChild(qumlPlayerElement);
  ```
- :arrow_forward: Refer demo [example](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/blob/release-5.7.0/web-component-examples/vanilla-js/index.html)

# Use as Web component  in the Angular app

- Run command 
  ```bash
    npm i @project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player-web-component
  ```

- Add these entries in angular json file inside assets, scripts and styles like below

  ```js
            "assets": [
              "src/favicon.ico",
              "src/assets",
              {
                "glob": "**/*.*",
                "input": "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player-web-component/assets",
                "output": "/assets/"
              }
            ],
            "styles": [
              "src/styles.scss",
              "node_modules/@project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player-web-component/styles.css"
            ],
            "scripts": [
              "node_modules/@project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player-web-component/sunbird-quml-player.js"
            ]

  ```

- Import  CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA in app module and add it to the NgModule as part of schemas like below

	```javascript
  ...
  import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
  ...

  @NgModule({
    ...
    schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
    ...
  })

	```

- Integrating sunbird-quml-player web component in angular component
    
  Create a viewChild in html template of the angular component like

  ```bash

      <div #qumlPlayer></div>

  ```

  Refer the viewChild in ts file of the component and create the quml player using document.createElement, then attach the player config and listen to the player and telemetry events like below and since we are rendering using viewChild these steps should be under ngAfterViewInit hook of the angular component.

  ```bash

  ....

  @ViewChild('qumlPlayer') qumlPlayer: ElementRef;

    ....
   ngAfterViewInit() {
      const playerConfig = <Config need be added>;
        const qumlElement = document.createElement('sunbird-quml-player');
        qumlElement.setAttribute('player-config', JSON.stringify(playerConfig));

        qumlElement.addEventListener('playerEvent', (event) => {
          console.log("On playerEvent", event);
        });

        qumlElement.addEventListener('telemetryEvent', (event) => {
          console.log("On telemetryEvent", event);
        });
        this.qumlPlayer.nativeElement.append(qumlElement);
    }
    ....

  ```

  **Note:** : Click to see the mock - [playerConfig](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/blob/release-5.7.0/projects/quml-demo-app/src/app/quml-library-data.ts) and send input config as string 

- Pass the Question List API baseUrl for, e.g. 
  ```
  ngAfterViewInit() {
    ...
    (window as any).questionListUrl = "https://staging.sunbirded.org/api/question/v1/list";
    ...
  }
  ```
- You're done! Sunbird QuML Player is now ready to play in your application.
  Use the following CLI command to run your application locally
  ```
  npm run start
  ```
  To see your application in the browser, Go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).




# Use as Angular library in angular app
For help getting started with a new Angular app, check out the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli).
If you have an Angular â‰¥ 9 CLI project, you could simply use our schematics to add sunbird-quml-player library to it.

For existing apps, follow the below-mentioned steps:

## :label: Installation
Just run the following:
```red
ng add @project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player
```
It will install sunbird-quml-player for the default application specified in your `angular.json`. If you have multiple projects, and you want to target a specific application, you could specify the `--project` option

```red
ng add @project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player --project myProject
```
Schematics will create `question-cursor-implementation.service.ts`. Please update the `listUrl` in it.
For more information refer [question-cursor-implementation.service.ts](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/blob/main/projects/quml-demo-app/src/app/question-cursor-implementation.service.ts) and do not forget to add your question list API URL here, for example: listUrl = "https://staging.sunbirded.org/api/question/v1/list";

### Manual installation
If you prefer not to use schematics or want to add `sunbird-quml-player` to an older project, you'll need to do the following:

<details>
  <summary>Click here to show detailed instructions!</summary>

  ### :label: Step 1: Install Packages
  These are the peer Dependencies of the library, need to be installed in order to use this library.

    npm install @project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player --save
    npm install @project-sunbird/sb-styles --save
    npm install @project-sunbird/client-services --save
    npm install bootstrap@^4.6.2 --save
    npm install jquery --save
    npm install katex --save
    npm install lodash-es --save
    npm install ngx-bootstrap@^10.0.0 --save


  Note: *As QuML library is build with angular version 15, we are using **bootstrap@^4.6.2** and **ngx-bootstrap@^10.0.0** which are the compatible versions.
  For more reference Check compatibility document for ng-bootstrap [here](https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/documentation#compatibility)*  
  
  ## :label: Step 2: Add question-cursor-implementation.service
  Create a **question-cursor-implementation.service.ts** in a project and which will implement the `QuestionCursor` abstract class.  
  `QuestionCursor` is an abstract class, exported from the library, which needs to be implemented. Basically, it has some methods which should make an API request over HTTP

  For more information refer [question-cursor-implementation.service.ts](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/blob/main/projects/quml-demo-app/src/app/question-cursor-implementation.service.ts) and do not forget to add your question list API URL here, for example: listUrl = "https://staging.sunbirded.org/api/question/v1/list";

  ### :label: Step 3: Include the styles, scripts and assets in angular.json
  Add the following under `architect.build.assets` for default project  
```javascript
{
  ...
  "build": {
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
    "options": {
      ...
      ...
      "assets": [
        ...
        ...
        {
         "glob": "**/*.*",
         "input": "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player/lib/assets/",
         "output": "/assets/"
        }
      ],
      "styles": [
        ...
        "src/styles.css",
        "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/sb-styles/assets/_styles.scss",
        "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player/lib/assets/styles/quml-carousel.css",
        "./node_modules/katex/dist/katex.min.css"
      ],
      "scripts": [
        ...
        "./node_modules/katex/dist/katex.min.js",
        "./node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"
      ]
    }
  }
  ...
  ...
},
```
  
## :label: Step 4: Import the modules and components
Import the required modules such as **CarouselModule**, **QumlLibraryModule**, **HttpClientModule** and **question-cursor-implementation.service** as below:

```javascript
  import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
  import { QumlLibraryModule, QuestionCursor } from '@project-sunbird/sunbird-quml-player';
  import { CarouselModule } from 'ngx-bootstrap/carousel';
  import { QuestionCursorImplementationService } from './question-cursor-implementation.service';

  @NgModule({
   ...

   imports: [ QumlLibraryModule, CarouselModule.forRoot(), HttpClientModule ],
   providers: [{
     provide: QuestionCursor,
     useClass: QuestionCursorImplementationService
   }]

   ...
  })

 export class AppModule { }
```

</details>

Note: To avoid CORS errors, add proxy configuration for API's refer - [proxy.conf.json](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/blob/release-5.7.0/projects/quml-demo-app/src/proxy.conf.json)

## :label: Send input to render QuML player
User can get a response from the `api/questionset/v1/hierarchy/:do_id` or can use the provided mock config for demo

Use the mock config in your component to send input to QuML player as `playerConfig`
Click to see the mock - [samplePlayerConfig](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/player/blob/release-5.7.0/projects/quml-demo-app/src/app/quml-library-data.ts#L495)

```html
<quml-main-player [playerConfig]="samplePlayerConfig" ><quml-main-player>
```


## :orange_circle: Available components

### :small_red_triangle_down: Input Parameters
playerConfig: Object - [`Required`]
```javascript
{
  context: Object    // Optional. Information about the telemetry and default settings for quml API requests
  metadata: Object  // Question hierarchy response
  config: Object   // default player config such as sidebar menu list
}
```
**Note:**  **context** is optional, which is used for capturing the telemetry event.
If context is not passed in playerConfig telemetry event of player will not be captured.

- Here is the detailed description of playerConfig: [player-configuration](https://inquiry.sunbird.org/learn/product-and-developer-guide/question-set-player/player-configuration)

### :small_red_triangle_down: Output Events
1. playerEvent()    - It provides heartbeat event for each action performed in the player.
2. telemetryEvent() - It provides the sequence of telemetry events such as `START, INTERACT, IMPRESSION, SUMMARY, END`
