replayed: boolean: An input property that indicates whether the question is being replayed.
baseUrl: string: An input property that holds the base URL used for resources or assets.

componentLoaded: EventEmitter<any>: An output event emitted when the component is loaded.
showAnswerClicked: EventEmitter<any>: An output event emitted when the user clicks on the "Show Answer" button.
sendData: EventEmitter<any>: An output event emitted to send data from the child (component) to the parent.

## Properties
showAnswer: boolean: A property that controls whether the answer is shown.
solutions: any: A property that holds the solutions to the question, if available.
question: any: A property that contains the question body.
answer: any: A property that holds the answer to the question.
min: number: A property that represents the minimum value of the slider.

step: number: A property that represents the step or increment value of the slider.
questionName: any: A property that contains the HTML content of the question to be displayed.

## Methods
onSliderChange(value: string): A method that is triggered when the slider value changes. It updates the sliderValue property based on the new value.

sendDataToParent(data: any): A method that is triggered when the user clicks the slider to send the selected sliderValue to the parent component using the showAnswerClicked output event.

Lifecycle Hook
ngOnInit(): A lifecycle hook that is executed when the component is initialized. It initializes the component properties with the input values.

popUpBox(): A method called for toggling the value of showPopUpBox, which will set the boolean value of showPopUpBox as true or false.

## Template
This component is designed to be used in Angular applications to handle slider-based questions. The template displays the question, slider input, and related elements. The onSliderChange() method is used to update the sliderValue property when the slider is moved, and the sendDataToParent() method is used to emit the showAnswerClicked event when the user clicks on the slider to send the selected value to the parent component.
